\subsection{MNIST Workflow}\label{mnist-workflow}

MNIST is a well-known program to detect handwritten digits. It
provides for our work value because it is well understood and is used
in many educational efforts. Also here we created a workflow that
integrates the UVA Rivanna HPC (it can easily be adapted to other machines).
The nice feature about this application is that it can be configured
to run very quickly while still using various GPUs and benchmark their runtimes for running
several MNIST Python programs. These programs include machine learning
processing, convolutional neural network, long short-term memory,
recurrent neural network, and others. The programs can be found on
GitHub~\cite{www-mnist-programs}.

As for the workflow we adapted it not only to run one algorithm but
multiple in an iteration across the GPUs (similar to \ref{fig:cloudmaskwf}).

On a successful run, the output will be receiving runtimes similar to:
