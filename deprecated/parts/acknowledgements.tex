\section*{Acknowledgements}

Continued work was in part funded by the NSF CyberTraining: CIC:
CyberTraining for Students and Technologies from Generation Z with the
award numbers 1829704 and 2200409 and NIST 60NANB21D151T. We like to
thank the students that participated in the REU for their help and
evaluation in a pre-alpha version of the code. We are excited that
this effort contributed significantly to their increased understanding
of Python and how to develop in a team using the Python ecosystem.
