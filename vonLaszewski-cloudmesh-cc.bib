  abstract =	 {This thesis contributes to the area of data analysis
                  as used in atmospheric science and provides a
                  metacomputing environment for grand challenge
                  problems. In order to achieve a valid climate
                  forecast, an accurate initial condition is needed to
                  apply the governing equations describing the
                  model. Data analysis techniques are able to derive
                  this initial state from irregular distributed
                  observations. This thesis provides a parallel
                  algorithm for the data analysis. Algorithms using
                  static and dynamic decomposition are introduced and
                  their performance is analyzed. A decomposition with
                  linear speedup is presented.During the
                  parallelization many different computers and
                  programming paradigms have been utilized. In order
                  to simplify the access for the user and developer a
                  metacomputing environment has been developed. The
                  meta-computing environment allows one to generate
                  message passing parallel programs from a visual
                  representation of a task graph. Besides the creation
                  of stand-alone parallel programs, the task graph can
                  be transferred into separate jobs executed on
                  different supercomputers. Messages between the jobs
                  are exchanged with the help of files. The underlying
                  concept for this metacomputing environment is a
                  dynamical dataflow model allowing multi-paradigm
                  programming. A dynamical task scheduling algorithm
                  determines on which component of the metacomputer a
                  task is scheduled and which algorithm performs the
                  task. The execution of the program is visually
                  animated.},
